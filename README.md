## Installation

As of now, this is only meant for my personal use, and is WIP, but usage instructions are below that will ensure if you do use this, it won't change out from under you.

> **Warning**
> If you decide to use one of these actions, make sure to pin the action to a specific SHA or tag.

To be totally safe, you can fork this repo and use your own fork as the source of the action while I continue to iterate on this.

## Composite Actions

- Setup
  - `setup-node`
  - `setup-ruby`
- Linters
