## Installation

**ðŸš¨ DANGER ðŸš¨**

This is still a work in progress and things are likely to change. If you decide to use one of these actions, make sure to pin the action to a specific SHA to ensure it doesn't change out from under you as I experiment.

## Usage/Examples

```yml
name: "Ruby on Rails CI"
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:11-alpine
        ports:
          - "5432:5432"
        env:
          POSTGRES_DB: rails_test
          POSTGRES_USER: rails
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
