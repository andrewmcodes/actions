## Installation

**ðŸš¨ DANGER ðŸš¨**

This is still a work in progress and things are likely to change. If you decide to use one of these actions, make sure to pin the action to a specific SHA to ensure it doesn't change out from under you as I experiment.

## Usage/Examples

## Contributing

Contributions will be welcome once this becomes a little more stable.
